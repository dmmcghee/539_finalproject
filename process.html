        <h1>Taking Matters into My Own Hands</h1>
        <br>

        <p class="text2">I took on the challenge of making my own afrofuturistic heroes inspired by different looks and pieces of black culture and representation while also nerding out and having fun as I fell deep in my own radical reimagination.  The Black Blades are three brothers who are freedom fighters in a cyberpunk future, battling against the malevolent government androids in America. I wanted to do something fun and symbolic with black Americans as I wanted my characters to represent themselves quite literally through the colors of the American Flag.  The three brothers are following: </p>
    <div class="container">
        <h2 id="subhead" class="sec_1">The Sophisticate</h2>
        <p id="text" class="sec_1">Merlot is the oldest brother of the three and acts a lot as the shot caller of the entire group. While he is clean and proper, he isn’t scared to push back and never backs down from a challenge as long as he has his blade. Not wanting to be associated with the color red exactly, his Codename Merlot is more of the color in which he likes to resemble himself the most. When I was looking for inspiration for his character, I thought of dapper black fashion incorporating a suit with a few pieces of jewelry and accessories.  Thinking of aesthetics in current media, I thought of Agent Six from Generator Rex, a swordsman in a full suit who can get the job done. I wanted to find ways to make this character black while showcasing the cornrows and the gold chain a little more, exemplifying his blackness, which is beautiful.

        <h2 id="subhead" class="sec_2">The Wild Card</h2>
        <p id="text" class="sec_2">Wh1T3 (White) is one of the twins who plays everything by his own rules. Of all of the brothers, he is the most brash and explosive and always ready for a battle against the androids. While a swordsman like his brothers, he prefers using throwing knives from his utility pockets but also fights with the kunai and a hand knife. The inspiration behind this character was looking at tech wear and streetwear fashion and looking for ways to add blackness to his experience that lies directly in his durag and his shoe game wearing his black and white air max. I also wanted to borderline a robo-cop kind of feel to play on the relationship and historical trauma that black men have with law enforcement. Wh1T3 plays many roles within his story but never forgets that he can be free.</p>

        <h2 id="subhead" class="sec_3">The Intellectual</h2>
        <p id="text" class="sec_3">Blu is the younger twin and the brains of the group as he codes and engineers all of their technology. He’s fun and lighthearted and displays his intellect in ways and language which doesn’t feel performative as his talents speak for themselves. While he is a logical brother, he also can hold himself in a brawl using his sets of twin swords. When thinking of Blu, I really wanted to fall into casual wear but lean into the futuristic with his glowing swords and interface glasses but keeping him black with his halo turban with a braid and timberland boots (not pictured in the collection). Looking into inspirations from street artist vibes and characters like Myles Morales, I wanted Blu to show off his character in similar ways but highlight his intelligence in ways that feel authentic to him.</p>

    <p class="text2">Given my knowledge and inspiration, I took it upon myself to create physical representations of these characters. I mocked up looks and to find clothes and accessories to match the vibes of my newfound characters to make them real with the hope of creating media which represents these characters.
