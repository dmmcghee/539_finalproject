        <h2 id="subhead">Meet Dallas</h2>
        <p id="text">Dallas McGhee-Henry is a writer, photographer, painter, and filmmaker interested in the intersection between art and social change. Currently doing art as passion work, Dallas practices art as a mode of release while also being thrilled with always giving himself challenges. Always excited to improve himself and his art form, Dallas takes in his plethora of inspiration and doesn’t limit himself all in the pursuit for fun and change. He believes that art can be a part of everyone’s life, and everyone can be an artist. Being an advocate of art liberation, Dallas works to one day be a part of something bigger than himself, an art movement allowing artists to collaborate and successfully create work to uplift voices create and more opportunities for the artist community at large! ,</p>
