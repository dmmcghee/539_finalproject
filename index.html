        <h2 id="subhead" class="sec_1">What is Afrofuturism?</h2>
        <p id="text" class="sec_1">Afrofuturism is commonly defined as radical reimagination of the experiences of people from the African diaspora. The movement imagines a world that the diaspora can live in and thrive without ignoring the past and present. A tool which uplifts the community to show them that not only do they belong in the future, but also in what ways can even be possible. Most elements of afro-futurism depict black individuals mixed with science fiction elements that are inspired by cultural influences and artistic stylistic choices, empowering experiences across the spectrum of what it means to be black. When most people know of afrofuturism, they see figures of people in Africa which African inspired clothes and technology to embellish the beauty and greatness of the people in Africa but that is just the start. Afrofuturism follows the diaspora also which encapsulates black american, Afro-latinos, Jamaicans, etc. Africa is only the starting point. </p>

        <h2 id="subhead" class="sec_2">In the Media</h2>
        <p id="text" class="sec_2">Maybe the most profound example of Afrofuturism in the past few years that left an impact on the world is Marvel’s Black Panther (2018). This story follows King T’Challa as he governs over the fictional country of Wakanda. Within this film, we see a country inspired by African culture and civilization with technological advancements that far surpass any other civilization in the modern present. This film presented africans as royalty, warriors, scientists, superheroes, thriving individuals who aren’t struggling contrary to most beliefs that paint some african countries as lesser than countries. While some of this verbiage may be tangentially true about some areas in Africa, it paint’s a bad image on the continent as a whole. Additionally, for people from more impoverished parts of Africa, this movie paints a future that individuals can believe in. Additionally, following right behind The Black Panther was Spiderman: Into the Spider-Verse (2018) which showcased an Afro-latino Spider-Man, which additionally painted the african diaspora in a positive light while incorporating many themes intertwined with black hip-hop culture.

        <h2 id="subhead" class="sec_3">Why it matters!</h2>
        <p id="text" class="sec_3">Current representations of black people in films are getting better but oftentimes black characters are painted in monolithic ways and/or treated as a box to check on a production as casting teams have hired the token black character. In black cinema, their same narrative is told that creates and further perpetuates a stereotype of what the black experience is. These media representations then set a negative image to not only others outside the community but also black individuals who cannot see themselves in a position of power as they are surrounded by negative examples of their worth. With more afrofuturistic media, the notion of what black is can be more celebrated in general. In terms of media, this movement isn’t exclusive, rather its an inclusive media form that can educate all and invite others to celebrate and uplift the black community. Personally inspired, I felt motivated to ideate and create a my own representations.</p>
